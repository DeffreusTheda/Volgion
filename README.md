###### Version: 1.1
**Volgion** is an open-source Java project, bundling the programs I've made to accelerate in IB Computer Science<br>
I've only started learning Java in August 2023, so the code quality might be subpar, I guess<br>
Nevertheless, anyone is allowed to give feedback and even contributions, that would be much appreciated 💖
###### <div style="text-align: center;">btw this is my first time using github so idk how things work here kekw</div><br><hr>
# 🍎・Wanna try it out??
Here are the guide to try out this project in MacOs:
## Prerequisites: 
### Download Java Development Kit (JDK)
1. Click [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to download JDK! (For most of you it would be the `ARM64 DMG Installer`)<br>

2. Once done, open the JDK installer with the `.dmg` file extension! (It's probably on your user's `Downloads` folder)<br>
3. Follow through the installation process
###### How to verify you completed the installation:
4. Open up your desired terminal application! Default are:<br>
       - 'Terminal' for MacOs & Linux!<br>
       - 'Command Prompt' for Windows!<br>
5. Type `java --version` to verify it!<br>
6. If it's installed, it should be like this:<br>

(That's just how my terminal looked because I've customized it, yours should be different)

## Downloading & Running Volgion
1. Download the file above: `Volgion.java`! (Just place it on your Downloads folder for convenient sake)<br>
2. Once done, open up `Terminal`, and enter these commands: <br>
- `cd /Users/USERNAME/Downloads`<br>
- `javac Volgion.java`
- `java Volgion`
3. 🎉・It should now run the Volgion Program, have fun!・🎊<br><hr><br>
